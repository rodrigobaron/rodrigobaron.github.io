Hi, I'm Rodrigo. I am a Software Developer that live in Medianeira, PR. Also
graduated in Information Systems at [UTFPR](http://www.utfpr.edu.br/) and
married with an amazing person called [Kellyn](https://twitter.com/kellynzotti) ^^.

The label "Software Developer" seems generic nowadays but I prefer to keep
things simple :). I have Full Stack Web Development experiences but I really like server side development.
